# Spreadsheet
Spreadsheet that can manage formulas and several functions 
in order to perform some calculations.

### Features available
- Add text to a cell
- Add numbers to a cell
- Compute a formula inside a cell
- Usage of functions inside a formula such as:
  - SUM
  - MIN
  - MAX
  - AVERAGE

# Usage
We recommend to use Pycharm as IDE, and with the option of running the Current File (play green button on the top right side of the screen after selecting the option Current File) when being inside app.py instead of running it by console.
This is due to the fact that the textual interface gets seen nicely when running through this option rather than by the console directly.

# DISCLAIMER
## IMPORTANT!
1. Python version minimum 3.10.0

2. When passing the marker, please make sure that the file in marker/SpreadsheetMarkerForStudents/markerrun/marker_save_test.s2v gets **deleted**, because in our project, if we try to save a file with a name that corresponds to another file in local, it gets caught as an error.

3. marker/SpreadsheetMarkerForStudents/markerrun/load_test.py, in Line 104 column 96, we added a comment because we think there was an error. In this position, there was a comma (,) instead of a semicolon (;) which by the context we think it was meant to be a semicolon If this is not the case, please remove it and sorry for the inconvenience.

4. marker/SpreadsheetMarkerForStudents/markerrun/circular_dependencies_test.py, in L108.
There is an error stating that we have a circular dependency when it's not true
